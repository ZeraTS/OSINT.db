# Introduction ‚úçÔ∏è

Welcome to the **osint.db** repository! This project leverages ScyllaDB to store large amounts of data efficiently. Initially, I experimented with different databases like MongoDB and MySQL for search queries yet felt dis-satisfied, and ultimately discovered this resource. My main goal was to understand how sites like IntelX and Snusbase handle breached information at massive scales with billions of lines. Feel free to explore the source code. While it's not my prettiest work, with some effort and tinkering, you could develop a REST API using the provided resource.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Concurrent Processing:** Efficient multi-threading with `ThreadPoolExecutor`.
- **Data Handling:** Powerful data manipulation using `pandas` and CSV operations.
- **User Interface:** Simple GUI interactions with `tkinter`.
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time progress bars with `tqdm`.
- **Rich Text Formatting:** Enhanced console output using `rich`.
- **Database Interaction:** Seamless integration with Cassandra using `cassandra-driver`.
- **Asynchronous I/O:** Non-blocking file operations with `asyncio` and `aiofiles`.
- **Memory Management:** Effective garbage collection with `gc`.
- **Multiprocessing:** Parallel processing capabilities with `multiprocessing`.
